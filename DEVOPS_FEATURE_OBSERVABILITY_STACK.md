# DevOps Feature: Enterprise-Grade Observability Stack for Banking Microservices (EYWP)

## üìã Feature Summary

**Feature ID**: EYWP-OBS-001  
**Epic**: Banking Platform Observability  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: 8-10 Story Points  
**Target Release**: Q4 2025  

## üéØ Business Objective

Implement a comprehensive, production-ready observability stack for the banking microservices platform across 4 production environments (DEV, UAT, STAGING, PROD) to enable:
- **Real-time monitoring** of business-critical banking operations
- **Proactive incident detection** reducing MTTR by 60%
- **End-to-end distributed tracing** for complex financial transactions
- **Unified observability** across all environments with single-pane-of-glass visibility
- **Compliance-ready audit trails** for financial operations

## üèóÔ∏è Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Existing Components
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana (basic metrics)
- **Log Aggregation**: Loki + Promtail (centralized logging)
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker-based deployment
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka Server
- **Configuration Management**: Spring Config Server

### ‚ùå Missing Critical Components
- **Distributed Tracing**: Limited Tempo integration, no business context
- **Application Performance Monitoring**: No deep service insights
- **Business Metrics**: No financial KPIs or domain-specific metrics
- **Multi-Environment Support**: No environment-aware dashboards
- **Advanced Alerting**: No intelligent alerting rules
- **Correlation**: No trace-to-log-to-metric correlation

## üöÄ Proposed Solution: Three Pillars of Observability

### 1. üìä Enhanced Metrics (Prometheus + Custom Business Metrics)

#### Current Implementation Gaps:
- Only basic HTTP metrics available
- No business domain metrics (transaction amounts, customer tiers, account types)
- No SLA/SLO tracking for financial operations

#### Proposed Enhancements:
```yaml
Business Metrics to Implement:
  - banking.transaction.amount{service, type, customer_tier}
  - banking.account.balance_changes{account_type, currency}
  - banking.customer.interaction_rate{tier, channel}
  - banking.loan.approval_rate{risk_category, amount_range}
  - banking.card.transaction_velocity{card_type, merchant_category}
  - banking.compliance.audit_events{regulation_type, severity}
```

### 2. üìú Structured Logging (Loki + Enhanced Context)

#### Current Implementation Gaps:
- Basic log aggregation without correlation IDs
- No structured logging with business context
- Missing audit trail for financial operations

#### Proposed Enhancements:
```json
Enhanced Log Structure:
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-22T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "service": "accounts-service",
  "environment": "PROD",
  "trace_id": "abc123def456",
  "span_id": "789xyz012",
  "business_context": {
    "customer_id": "CUST_12345",
    "account_id": "ACC_67890",
    "transaction_type": "TRANSFER",
    "amount": 1500.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "compliance_category": "AML_CHECK"
  },
  "message": "Account transfer initiated",
  "correlation_id": "TXN_20250922_001234"
}
```

### 3. üîç Distributed Tracing (Tempo + OpenTelemetry + Business Context)

#### Current Implementation Gaps:
- Basic OTEL integration without business semantics
- No parent-child span relationships for complex workflows
- Missing business context in traces

#### Proposed OTEL Code Enhancements:

```java
// Enhanced Business Context Tracing
@Component
public class EnhancedBusinessTracer {
    
    @NewSpan("banking.transfer.initiate")
    public void initiateTransfer(
        @SpanAttribute("customer.id") String customerId,
        @SpanAttribute("account.from") String fromAccount,
        @SpanAttribute("account.to") String toAccount,
        @SpanAttribute("amount") BigDecimal amount) {
        
        // Create child spans for each business step
        validateAccount(fromAccount);
        checkBalance(fromAccount, amount);
        performTransfer(fromAccount, toAccount, amount);
        updateAuditLog(customerId, amount);
    }
    
    @NewSpan("banking.validation.account")
    private void validateAccount(String accountId) {
        Span.current()
            .setAttributes(Attributes.of(
                stringKey("validation.type"), "ACCOUNT_EXISTENCE",
                stringKey("account.id"), accountId,
                booleanKey("validation.passed"), true
            ));
    }
}
```

## üåç Multi-Environment Architecture

### Environment-Aware Configuration

```yaml
# Prometheus Federation Setup
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  external_labels:
    environment: ${ENVIRONMENT}
    region: ${REGION}
    cluster: ${CLUSTER_NAME}

# Environment-specific Grafana Datasources
datasources:
  - name: "Prometheus-DEV"
    uid: "prometheus-dev"
    url: "http://prometheus-dev.internal:9090"
    
  - name: "Prometheus-UAT" 
    uid: "prometheus-uat"
    url: "http://prometheus-uat.internal:9090"
    
  - name: "Prometheus-STAGING"
    uid: "prometheus-staging" 
    url: "http://prometheus-staging.internal:9090"
    
  - name: "Prometheus-PROD"
    uid: "prometheus-prod"
    url: "http://prometheus-prod.internal:9090"
```

### Unified Dashboard Architecture

```json
{
  "templating": {
    "list": [
      {
        "name": "environment",
        "type": "custom",
        "options": [
          {"text": "Development", "value": "dev"},
          {"text": "UAT", "value": "uat"}, 
          {"text": "Staging", "value": "staging"},
          {"text": "Production", "value": "prod"}
        ],
        "current": {"text": "Production", "value": "prod"}
      },
      {
        "name": "datasource",
        "type": "datasource",
        "regex": "/prometheus-${environment}/"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
